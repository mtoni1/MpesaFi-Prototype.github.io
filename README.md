# MpesaFi-Prototype.github.io
MpesaFi exists to unlock decentralized, mobile-first financial access for underserved communities in Kenya and beyond. We believe that everyone, regardless of income level, should have access to affordable, transparent, and borderless financial tools.
# Decentralized Financial Platform for Kenya
* Project Overview
MpesaFi is a DeFi-powered mobile finance platform designed to enhance and eventually complement or replace traditional mobile money services like M-Pesa in Kenya. It aims to provide secure, low-cost, and transparent financial services leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and stablecoins, while maintaining interoperability with Kenyan banks and existing mobile money infrastructure.

* Problem Statement
While M-Pesa revolutionized mobile payments in Kenya, users still face challenges such as:

High transaction fees for certain services
Limited access to advanced financial products like decentralized lending, savings, and investments
